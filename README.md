# Receipt Download
Downloads tenancy receipts from a link in a email

A project that took 7 hours and 30 minutes.
Lots of incomplete projects in my past. This is something I’m proud of. 


But I’m sure there are improvements to be made.
I can see some areas where concurrancy could speed up mass proccesing.
I'm thinking about where i range over ```list``` and ```linkList``` in main.go
